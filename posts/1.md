Hello! Nice to meet you there. My name is Alonso and I am a recent computer science graduate. I enjoy learning
about various programming topics from blockchain to the latest JavaScript frameworks. I first started out
programming in high school and was quickly drawn into the field. I chased my curiosity all the way through my
undergraduate studies. Since my education, I have been craving a way to do more learning and grow as a developer.
As a result I have created this blog to track my curiosity and share it with anyone interested. I hope that I can
help someone continue to learn and grow as a developer through these posts.
